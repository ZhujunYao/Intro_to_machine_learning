Class project: Identifying Bird Species in Accipitriformes Order Using Maching Learning
Our project aims to use DNA sequences to judge similarity between or inside 3 families under Accipitriformes order and to identify the accipitriformes birds to species level by machine learning approaches such as multinomial naive bayes, random forest, and decision tree.
